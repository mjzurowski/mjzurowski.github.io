This page is still a work in progress, but [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMaJOlN3rTAmK-Ta65q9AvL_SAAlL6ZyJ1xkhGh-9bg/edit?usp=sharing) you can find a collection of papers and resources I have found helpful in building up my physics knowledge.

## Technical papers

### Dark matter as a concept
* [PDG DM review](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/web/viewer.html?file=../reviews/rpp2024-rev-dark-matter.pdf) (Baudis and Profumo): general overview of the motivation for DM and various test methods (direct, indirect, collider)
* [History of Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04909) (Bertone and Hooper): overview of the historical perspective/evolution of the fields' understanding of DM

### Building and testing DM observables
* [Lewin and Smith](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927650596000473): basic derivation of direct detection DM rates.
* [The Effective Field Theory of Dark Matter Direct Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3542): a more detailed theoretical formalism for general DM interactions.
* [A Refinement of the Standard Halo Model for Dark Matter Searches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11468): refinement of the standard velocity distribution assumptions. Good description of how this is calculated and included in DM rates.
* [Chapter of my thesis](https://mjzurowski.github.io/files/rate_calcs.pdf): combines the EFT formalism and more general velocity distribution (without worrying too much how either are derived) with experimental effects to get the observation rate (similar to Lewin and Smith with a more detailed interaction model).
* [Recommended conventions for reporting results from direct dark matter searches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00599): generally good conventions put together by members of a range of different DM direct detection experiments. Also provides a baseline DM model to make sure comparisons between experiments are in an “apples to apples regime”.
* [Direct Detection of sub-GeV Dark Matter with Semiconductor Targets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01598): similarly to the EFT paper, this lays out a theoretical formalism for sub-GeV DM scattering with electron.
* [Migdal Effect in Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07258): original paper that explores the concept of the Migdal effect and derives the relevant parameters
* [Directly detecting sub-GeV dark matter with electrons from nuclear scattering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09906): a great example of the application of the Migdal effect to experimental limits

There are also some interesting thoughts on research as a student and a supervisor in [this](https://mjzurowski.github.io/files/Postgraduate_Survival_Guide_ch5.pdf) chapter of a postgraduate survival guide I helped to write many moons ago.
