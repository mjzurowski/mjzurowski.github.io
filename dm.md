# Intro to Dark Matter

Dark Matter (DM, often represented with the Greek letter &#967;) is a hypothetical particle that doesn't interact with light, a particular feature that makes it very hard to observe. It's existence is hinted at by a number of different phenomena, in particular the way galaxies rotate and collide, and where mass seems to be distributed across the Universe (inferred using observations of its gravitational influence). Basically, when we look out at the Universe, the maths tells us that there is more matter out there than can be seen - hence the name `dark'.

Now that we know (or rather, strongly suspect) there's something out there, how do we work out what it is?

To categorise DM, particle physicists are interested in two things: its mass (m) and cross section (&#963;). The first term should be fairly self explanatory, but the second tells us how likely DM is to interact with regular matter, and how that interaction might occur (regular matter being what is described by the Standard Model of Particle Physics). One of the difficult things about DM is that physicists really aren't sure what mass range DM should have, though some may have their own favourite pet theory. Because the possible mass range is so large, it is very difficult to build an experiment thatcan probe all of it at once. Instead, each experiment targets a smaller range, one bite at a time.

So once we have a mass range in mind, how do we go about measuring these values?
