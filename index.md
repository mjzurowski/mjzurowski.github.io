# Madeleine J. Zurowski
Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto working on dark matter direct detection.

Dark matter hunter, coffee and puzzle enthusiast. 

My work for both my MSc and PhD has been on the direct detection of Dark Matter (DM) with the SABRE experiment, while my postdoc work has been on SuperCDMS (non-physicists may find [Intro to Dark Matter](https://mjzurowski.github.io/dm) more illuminating than the information in the [Research](https://mjzurowski.github.io/research-outputs) section).

I am particularly interested in rare event searches/low background physics, and experimental design to support the next generation of these detectors.
