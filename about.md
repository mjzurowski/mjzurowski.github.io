# About
I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia, and yet have somehow managed to develop and maintain a fairly strong Canadian accent. I moved to Melbourne after finishing high school, where I've received my BSc, MSc, and PhD from the University of Melbourne. I am currently working at the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow.

Despite getting all my degrees from the same place, I have been lucky enough to study and live at both University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate, and Princeton University as a visiting graduate researcher. With family in both Canada and Europe, I love the opportunities to travel that research has presented me with so far. The most incredible to date is definitely the chance to fly over Antarctic airspace (where the header photo is from).

My area of interest is dark matter and other low background physics processes. Formally an experimentalist working on the direct detection of dark matter, I also enjoy dabbling in phenomenology and collaborating with theorists and astrophysicists to understand how different particle interaction models and velocity distributions would manifest in particular detectors. I am currently a member of the [SuperCDMS Experiment](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/), [SABRE Experiment](https://www.sabre-experiment.org.au/) and the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Dark Matter Particle Physics](https://www.centredarkmatter.org/).

## CV
My CV can be found [here](https://mjzurowski.github.io/files/ZurowskiCV.pdf) and is updated semi-regularly. A list of my talks and publications can also be found at [Research Outputs](https://mjzurowski.github.io/research-outputs).

## Contact
You can get in touch using either my [University](mailto:madeleine.zurowski@utoronto.ca) or [personal](mailto:mjzurowski@gmail.com) emails. I also spend (probably too much) time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjzurowski).
