I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia, moving to Melbourne for university where I received my BSc, MSc, and PhD from the University of Melbourne. I am currently working at the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow.

Despite getting all my degrees from the same place, I have been lucky enough to study and live at both University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate, and Princeton University as a visiting graduate researcher.

My area of interest is dark matter and other low background physics processes. Formally an experimentalist working on the direct detection of dark matter, I also enjoy dabbling in phenomenology and collaborating with theorists and astrophysicists to understand how different particle interaction models and velocity distributions would manifest in particular detectors. I am currently a member of the [SuperCDMS Experiment](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/), [SABRE Experiment](https://www.sabre-experiment.org.au/) and the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Dark Matter Particle Physics](https://www.centredarkmatter.org/).

## CV
My CV can be found [here](https://mjzurowski.github.io/files/ZurowskiCV.pdf) and is updated semi-regularly. A list of my talks and publications can also be found at [Research Outputs](https://mjzurowski.github.io/research-outputs).

## Contact
You can get in touch using either my [University](mailto:madeleine.zurowski@utoronto.ca) or [personal](mailto:mjzurowski@gmail.com) emails. I also spend (probably too much) time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjzurowski), and share pictures of my work underground on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/mz_underground/).
